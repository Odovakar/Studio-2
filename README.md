This plotly project was created to display large amounts of data coming directly from the Regional Internet Registries.
The intent of the project is to visualise different cases of of IPv4 and IPv6 allocation accross the different continents.

The cases used within the project are used as a consolidator for arguments discussed within the broader article, relating to
the IPv4 draught, which countries have the most allocated addresses in comparison to factors as GDP, population size among several 
other talking points. The article also discusses that the IPv4 repositories have been empty for 10 years, and which measures and solutions
have been used to to mitigate/patch this problem, and the article also discusses with the help of visualisations of the IPv6 address pool
why haven't the inevitable transition over to v6 happened with its seemingly indepletable pool. Why is the threshold so high to transition, 
when we have out been of v4 for 10 years, and most systems these days already have a foundation for v6.
